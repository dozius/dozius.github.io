    <p>
      I've been making sounds, visuals, and more with computers and other junk
      since the late 90s. Over the years I've had appearances on record labels
      such as Point Source Electronic Arts, En:peg Digital, Component
      Recordings, Crunch Pod, and more. In the 2000s, I even played shows in
      some iconic venues around Toronto.

    <p>
      In April 2022, I started streaming live electronic music performances and
      co-founded a group of like minded artists doing the same. We organized
      large multi-day events, weekly shows, and a monthly songwriting
      challenge. The song challenge consisted of members from the community
      creating sample packs and then people creating tracks using only the
      sample pack contents. Later editions of the challenge allowed for using
      your own voice too.

    <p>
      In October 2023, I started my own semiregular series of <a
      href="/graverave">Grave Rave</a> events that take place in a spooky voxel
      graveyard powered by the <a href="https://www.cyberdoof.com">Cyberdoof</a>
      platform. These virtual events feature performances from some of the
      friends I've made in the streaming community and aim to be compact,
      casual, and silly fun.
    </p>

      I also have a professional background in electronics design and software
      development and have dabbled in DSP and music technology in my spare time.
      The intersection of art and technology is my happy place. You can find
      some of my open source work over on my <a
      href="https://github.com/dozius">Github</a> page.
